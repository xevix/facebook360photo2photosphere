Facebook 360 Photo to Photosphere Converter
===========================================

**Description**

Facebook 360 photos are not presently readily downloadable from Facebook and only viewable in VR via the Gear VR.
This simplistic script converts a Facebook 360 photo into a Google Cardboard / Photosphere compatible image.

**NB:** This script is quite raw and unrefined by design. Feel free to improve as you see fit to your own needs.

**Notice:** Facebook and Facebook 360 photos are copyright/trademark of Facebook Inc., Google and Google Cardboard are similarly copyright/trademark of Google Inc. I do not own any of this, and will remove this if requested by either party.

Dear Facebook: I love the addition of 360 photo uploads to Facebook. Please kindly consider allowing us to download these photos as Photospheres, since clearly Photosphere uploads are supported. If we want to talk about openness of our data, it has to be a two-way street.

## Requirements

* ImageMagick (`convert`)
* cube2sphere
  * Blender
* exiftool

On OSX via Homebrew and pip, install like so:

`brew install imagemagick exiftool && sudo pip install cube2sphere`

Cube2sphere requires Blender. Install via Blender's site, then ensure the `blender` binary is in your PATH.

## Instructions

1. Download the 360 image source from Facebook

  a. Browse to the 360 photo on whoever's wall it is at, but don't click to open the carousel viewer.

  b. Open your browser's "network" tab to monitor file download requests

  c. Click the photo to open the carousel viewer, triggering the download of the 360 photo file

  d. Inspect the network tab for the largest image file downloaded, and save this image to this script's path as `facebook_pano.jpg`

  e. Open the image. There should be 6 square images stacked vertically. If so, you have the right file.

2. Ensure the `facebook_pano.jpg` file is named as such, and move it into this script's directory if it isn't there already.

3. `sh ./fb2ps.sh` from this script's path

4. Output should be named `PANO_facebook_pano_out.jpg`

Now you can load this file into the StreetView app, or view via Cardboard Demos â†’ Photosphere if on Android.

Enjoy!

## TODO

* Obvious refactors into variables instead of copy+pasta
* Read filename as command line argument
* Error handling
* Better quality image `convert` params
* More automated installation of requirements
